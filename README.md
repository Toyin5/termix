## üöÄ Why You‚Äôll Love Termix

* Instant recursive filtering as you type (`S` ‚Üí search mode). Press `Esc` to apply the filter, navigate matches, then
  `Esc` again to clear.
* Create, rename, or delete files and directories right within the UI (`A`, `R`, `D`).
* Respects `.gitignore` and filters out `bin/`, `obj/`, `node_modules/` by default for speed and clarity.
* Double‚Äëbuffered UI ensures flicker‚Äëfree rendering and a smooth two‚Äëpane layout.
* Live syntax highlighting for `.cs`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, and more supported at preview time.
* Vim‚Äëstyle shortcuts: use `J/K` with arrows for fast navigation.
* Nerd‚ÄëFont glyphs (configurable fallback to ASCII mode).
* Cross‚Äëplatform: compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
